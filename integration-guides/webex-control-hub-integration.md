# Webex Control Hub Integration

Cisco's Webex Control Hub is the central interface to manage Webex organization, and users, assign Webex services, view their usage analytics, and more. When you use ThousandEyes together with Webex Control Hub, you get direct access to ThousandEyes path visualization data within Webex Control Hub. This helps network administrators identify root causes for negative participant experiences.
