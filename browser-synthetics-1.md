# Browser Synthetics

#### Cloud-centric Applications Demand a New Approach

Applications today are built on and delivered by an increasing number of external dependencies, from ISP networks to API services. In order to understand how employees or customers experience an application, and the impact of every network and service on performance, you need modern synthetics paired with deep network path and routing visibility.

ThousandEyes Browser Synthetics simulate users interacting with a website or application. Detailed page metrics and waterfalls are tightly correlated with underlying network and Internet issues to help you quickly isolate the root cause of application downtime. Run Synthetics from Cloud Agents deployed in hundreds of cities around the globe or from Enterprise Agents deployed in your own environment.

#### Powerful Web Transaction Engine

A Selenium-based, JavaScript transaction engine captures performance data across pages and down engagement funnels.

* Easily create complex transaction scripts using a robust web recorder.
* Leverage JavaScript to test for conditionals and asserts.&#x20;
* Group transaction steps for easy alerting and reporting.
* Run tests continuously, round-robin, or ad hoc.

#### Quickly Correlate Application and Network Performance

Immediately understand how every network affects your app performance, business transactions and end user experience. Optimize website performance with visibility into page load waterfalls, end-to-end performance, path tracing and Internet routing.
