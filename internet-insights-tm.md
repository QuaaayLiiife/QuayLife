# Internet Insights™

#### Digital Experience. Internet Scale.

Your customer and employee digital experiences rely on a vast ecosystem of ISPs, cloud providers, SaaS applications and many other external services that are critically dependent on the Internet. Yet, the complex and interdependent nature of the Internet makes outage detection and troubleshooting performance issues extremely difficult, and no single enterprise can monitor it alone.

ThousandEyes Internet Insights™ combines a massive data set with algorithmic outage detection to provide near real-time insights into the SaaS applications and networks your business relies on. With Internet Insights, you can manage digital experience at Internet scale.

#### Collective Intelligence for Authoritative Insight

ThousandEyes agents located across the Internet perform billions of measurements each day, creating a massive data set on when and where traffic flows are disrupted at the network-interface and application-server levels. This collective intelligence derived from sophisticated algorithms enables operations teams to rapidly identify, escalate and remediate issues with providers using concrete Internet telemetry data, rather than public rumor.

#### Network Outages: Powerful Visibility Across the Internet

Network outages can be highly disruptive and difficult to isolate—particularly if they take place within an upstream service provider. Internet Insights detects network outages across the Internet by algorithmically identifying common points where traffic is terminating within service provider networks. When outage behavior is detected, the autonomous system (AS) is isolated and the outage is presented visually via geographical and topological views. This powerful visibility helps IT operations perform network monitoring and isolate root causes when network performance or reachability of key infrastructure drops with respect to latency or packet loss.

#### Application Outages: Trusted ​​Visibility for Business-critical SaaS Apps

Managing user experience for SaaS applications can be challenging given the complexity of services today and how broadly users are distributed. Internet Insights provides immediate visibility into application availability, the nature of the outage, and its scale and geographic scope. With this information in hand, IT can eliminate unnecessary troubleshooting cycles and quickly (and confidently) communicate to stakeholders and employees.

#### Collaborate With Providers Proactively

Determining the ideal providers for your use case, and managing them successfully over time, can be challenging in the absence of a large, authoritative data set. Internet Insights tracks network and SaaS application provider outages in a timeline view so you can evaluate and compare similar applications to make the best vendor decisions for your business. You can also use concrete performance metrics to effectively collaborate with providers to optimize performance, enforce SLAs and reduce MTTR.

### Global Outages. Geographically Visualized.

Designed for IT Helpdesk and network operations centers (NOCs), the Internet Insights overview dashboard superimposes recent and ongoing outages onto a global map to provide IT teams a high-level visualization of Internet health. Customized reports and dashboards can be used to track outages and their impact on your services and report on the quality of your service providers.

### Why ThousandEyes?

**Managing the Internet is a modern business imperative**

Your customers and employees expect applications and services to be reachable on demand, at all times. Anything less than that can damage your revenue and reputation.

**The Internet is unpredictable and prone to outages**

The fabric of the global Internet is comprised of an interconnected web of infrastructure and providers. The complex nature of the Internet makes it especially vulnerable to outages.

**No business can monitor the Internet alone**

Most monitoring efforts focus on the provider’s network topology and infrastructure that you know about, but the interconnected nature of the Internet introduces risks well beyond your sphere of control.

Outages happen. Internet Insights can help you overcome them with confidence.
