# LAN Performance Monitoring Solution

ThousandEyes provides deep visibility into application delivery among devices connected to your LAN, WAN and over the Internet. Within your LAN (or mobile user networks), you can utilize wired and WiFi performance metrics from Endpoint Agents on user devices to quickly find faults with network links, access points, gateways and proxies. You can also get automatically alerted to wired and wireless LAN performance and quickly correlate to impacted users and services. Enterprise Agents can be used to auto-discover your network topology, gather device health metrics and monitor wireless access points, firewalls, routers, and switches. Collected data from your environment is then easily summarized to show top performance indicators across groups of users, applications and branch offices for LAN and WiFi devices.
