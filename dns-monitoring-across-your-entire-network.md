# DNS Monitoring Across Your Entire Network

### Why Is DNS Monitoring Important?

DNS is a foundational service without which your users would be unable to find or connect to your web services. Most businesses rely on external DNS providers to report on performance and DNS integrity, but they have little insight into DNS service, reachability, performance and real-time DNS record security. ThousandEyes sheds new light on the performance of DNS infrastructure, from caching servers to external providers. We monitor and test the performance of DNS servers, resolvers and records in your network and those of your providers across the DNS hierarchy. With ThousandEyes, you can see DNS performance side-by-side with routing, path tracing and app availability to help you collect data and test for DNS problems, such as server performance, caching errors, record misconfigurations and cache poisoning.

#### Test and Monitor DNS Resources Before Your Users Are Impacted

With ThousandEyes, you can monitor on-premises, hosted or third-party DNS servers to check availability, resolution speed and record mappings. You can also trace the entire DNS hierarchy for a record, from top-level domain servers to the authoritative server and understand if DNS infrastructure outside of your control is causing an outage or performance degradation.
