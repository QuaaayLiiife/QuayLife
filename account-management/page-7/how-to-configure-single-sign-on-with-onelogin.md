# How to Configure Single Sign-On with OneLogin

For the security of your SaaS-based infrastructure and the convenience of users in your organization, the ThousandEyes service offers login via single sign-on (SSO). ThousandEyes supports SAML2-based identity providers for single sign-on. There are two steps to set up single sign-on: the service provider configuration, which is done within ThousandEyes, and the identity provider configuration, done within your SSO system. In this configuration example, we use

[OneLogin](https://www.onelogin.com/)

as the identity provider.
