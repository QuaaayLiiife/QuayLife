# Usage-Based Billing

ThousandEyes entitlements take three forms: units, users/devices, and Internet Insights packages. Units are used for tests run from Cloud or Enterprise Agents.

This section describes usage-based billing in the ThousandEyes platform, including ways to get more value out of your available units.

In usage-based billing, where every ThousandEyes test run from a cloud or enterprise agent incurs units up to an agreed-upon threshold. Features such as Endpoint Agents and Internet Insights packages are license-based, and do not incur units.

Note that usage-based billing is only a portion of the subscriptions available from ThousandEyes. Other charges can include endpoint agent licenses, Internet Insights licenses and packages, and professional services.
