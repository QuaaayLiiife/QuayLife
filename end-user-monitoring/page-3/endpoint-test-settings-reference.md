| Configuration Option   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Timeout                | The number of second until the test terminates due to an unresponsive target server.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Target Time for View   | Sets the color legend on the global map, and the corresponding font colors for the agent results table. For example, Response Time for an HTTP server test sets the range of the legend from 0 seconds (green end) to 2x the Target Time for View (red end).                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Data Collection        | Enable this option to collect network metrics and create a path visualization.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Scheme                 | <p>Defines the type of authentication. The available options are:</p><ul><li>None/p></li><li>Basic (requires username and password configuration)</li><li>NTLM (requires username and password configuration)</li></ul>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Preferred Stack        | <p>Specifies if the agent-to-server test should use IPv4 or IPv6 networks. The available configuratio options are:</p><ul><li>IPv4 only</li><li>Prefer IPv6</li><li>Force IPv6</li></ul>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Request Method         | Select the HTTP request method - either GET or POST. If POST is selected, you may specify data in the POST Body field. The default is GET.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Follow Redirects       | Enable to have the pathtrace follow any redirects that are in place within the monitored domain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| SSL Version            | Defines the SSL version used.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Verify SSL Certificate | Uncheck this box to ignore certificate errors during SSL/TLS negotiation. By default, certificate-related errors will result in a test error.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| User Agent             | Defines the browser version and device used.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Custom Headers         | Enter one or more HTTP header strings in the form **stringname: value**. Ensure there is a space between the colon and value.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Override DNS           | Instead of using standard DNS resolution, this option allows you to specify the IP address to which the target's domain name will resolve. This option is useful for targeting a specific server within a cluster, or when testing HTTPS URLs which require a server name indication (SNI) in the SSL/TLS negotiation that is different from the domain name-to-IP address mapping required to access the URL.                                              |
| Desired Status Code    | Sets the HTTP status code returned by the server that is defined as a successful test (i.e. no errors will be displayed in the test table results, no response code-based alerts generated etc). By default, either a 200-level or 300-level status code is considered a successful return code. Uncheck this box and enter a response code in the field below to use a different expected response code.                                                   |
| Verify Content         | Search the HTTP headers and body for text which matches the expression in the Verify Content field. The expression can be a literal text or a POSIX regular expression. If no match occurs, the test shows an error condition.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Limit Download Size    | Load only the first number of kilobytes (kB) specified in the field below the Enable box. The result is not guaranteed to be exactly the number specified but can be slightly more, yet always within a few percent, or less as the size of the download is increased. Note that this function does not use an HTTP Range header, so the HTTP response code should not be affected (i.e. success is a 200 OK response, not a 206 Partial Content response). |
