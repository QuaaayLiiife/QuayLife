# Scheduled Tests

Scheduled tests run from Endpoint Agents at regularly scheduled intervals. You can create HTTP server tests and agent-to-server tests to run without user interaction, and to run as long as an Endpoint Agent is online, providing data from your remote workers, home workers, and smaller branch offices.
