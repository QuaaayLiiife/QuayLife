# Endpoint Agent Scheduled Tests View

The **Timeline** is the primary focus of all Endpoint Agent views. It shows test data from the last 30 days, or the length of time the test has been enabled (whichever is the lesser value). The data shown on the timeline can be manipulated by selecting the time range shortcuts, by clicking within the timeline to select a particular round of data, or by highlighting a range within the timeline, using the **Time Range Selector**.
