# End-User Monitoring

The Endpoint Agent is a lightweight service installed on an end user's laptop or desktop that monitors applications through a browser plug-in. Because Endpoint Agent goes where the user goes, you can use it to troubleshoot performance issues related to Wi-Fi, bandwidth capacity, ISP routing, VPN gateways, and SaaS availability.
