# Sending ThousandEyes Alerts via SMS

With an email-to-txt gateway, email can be sent to a special address which will convert the email to a text, and send the text to the phone number associated with that email address. Most commonly (in the USA), the email address is the 10-digit phone number, followed by the '@' sign, then the email domain the provider uses for email-to-txt messaging. For example, the fictitious provider "MegaISP" might use an email address of _\[email protected]_ for the customer whose phone number is (415) 555-6789.
