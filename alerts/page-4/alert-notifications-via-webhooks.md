# Alert Notifications Via Webhooks

Currently, custom webhooks you create in the ThousandEyes platform can ingest alerts based on Cloud Agent data, Enterprise Agent data, Endpoint Agent scheduled-test data and browser-session data, and BGP data. The platform currently does not support webhooks for alerts based on other kinds of Endpoint Agent data or on outage data.
