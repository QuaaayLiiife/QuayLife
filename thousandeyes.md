### How Do You Monitor CDNs?

CDN performance tests conducted using ThousandEyes Cloud Agents provide deep insights into CDN content delivery, including geographic CDN load balancing, latency, and availability. We monitor the performance of your application, origin, and CDN edge node, so you can quickly pinpoint and diagnose issues that impact a userâ€™s digital experience. Now, you can gain insight into how CDNs will affect application delivery in real-time and perform CDN comparisons across regions and over time with page load, transaction, and HTTP tests that include rich network measurements, Layer 3 path visualization, and BGP route visualizations.
