# Data

This article describes how to navigate to and interact with the ThousandEyes views. This document describes the two primary view layouts (standard and DNS+) used throughout the user interface of the application, and makes reference to two other interactive views.

ThousandEyes uses a standard top navigation bar throughout the entire application. The top nav layout is documented in the figure below.

The Menu appears on the left side of the application window, unless your window width is below a minimum size, in which case it will be hidden until the Menu toggle (#1 above) is clicked. The Menu provides access to the top-level pages of the application for configuration of tests, displaying of test results, and other major functions. The top-level entries on the Menu are described below.

Occasionally, a system notification may appear, announcing major new features or changes, or other system information. Each notification is only shown one time per user account, and can be dismissed either by clicking the link contained in the notification, or by clicking the X icon to the right of the notification. Notifications are always linked to an article posted in the Customer Success Center, so don't worry -- if you dismiss it accidentally, you can log in to

[https://support.thousandeyes.com](https://support.thousandeyes.com/)

to get the current notification. Here's a sample notification:

### ThousandEyes Standard Layout <a href="#thousandeyes-standard-layout" id="thousandeyes-standard-layout"></a>

The ThousandEyes standard view is used across all Network, DNS, Voice and Web tests. It provides a consistent layout when working with test results. The ThousandEyes standard view layout is documented in the figure below, with numbered callouts. Below the figure is a numbered list corresponding to the callouts, explaining each part of the layout.

![](https://2360053865-files.gitbook.io/\~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M4QARF6s57qxMrOHDTZ%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-3112fd1dc0d864b885bb9b12474462820791007f%2Fproduct-documentation\_thousandeyes-basics\_thousandeyes-view-layouts-11.png?alt=media)

1.  1\.

    **Test selector:** Use this control to change which test is being displayed in the standard layout. All tests of this type will be shown, including disabled tests.
2.  2\.

    **Views**: This menu lists views available for the test type selected. When switching views, the test selected and date/time selected in the timeline (#5) are persisted in the new view.
3.  3\.

    **Metric selector**: Use this control to change the context of the data shown in the timeline (#5), Table tab (#7) and averages (#8) areas.
4.  4\.

    **Agent selector**: Use this control to select an Agent location. This selection changes the content shown on the timeline (#3), detailed metrics (#7), averages area (#8) and world map (#9). All assigned locations are available for selection, and by default, the “All Agents” entry is selected. When an individual location is selected, click the X button to the right of the Agent name, or click into a background area of the world map (#9) to clear the location selection.
5.  5\.

    **Timeline:** By default, shows data for the lesser of 14 days or the length of time that the test has been enabled. When a location is selected (see #4), charts the location’s values against the average computed across all locations. To change the data displayed, either use the 24h (trailing 24 hours), 7d (trailing 7 days) or 14d (trailing 14 days) links, click the zoom out and latest buttons, or click and highlight the requested area of the map, and it will re-draw appropriately.
6.  6\.

    **Current round:** Indicates the time and date of the currently selected round in the timeline.
7.  7\.

    **Detailed Metrics tabs:** In the lower section of the layout, one or more tabs are available to show the world map, detailed metrics and data specific to the selected test type. For more information on each metric shown, see the

    [ThousandEyes Metrics: What do your results mean?](https://docs.thousandeyes.com/product-documentation/internet-and-wan-monitoring/tests/thousandeyes-metrics-what-do-your-results-mean)

    .
8.  8\.

    **Averages:** Based on the selected location, averages are computed for the selected metric for the time indicated by the date/time. The content shown in the averages varies widely by view.
9.  9\.

    **World map:** Uses geo-location data for agents to place agents on the map. The world map is zoomable using the controls to the right of the map or via mouse scrolling. Individual agents can be selected using this view, having the same effect as the Agent selector (#4).

    *   When a location is selected, it appears with a shadowed background (

        ![](https://2360053865-files.gitbook.io/\~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M4QARF6s57qxMrOHDTZ%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-7ab4a9cb1aefbaf72366f184c8388165e8e486cc%2Fproduct-documentation\_thousandeyes-basics\_thousandeyes-view-layouts-12.png?alt=media)

        ).
    *   Enterprise Agents are shown with a double-ringed border (

        ![](https://2360053865-files.gitbook.io/\~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M4QARF6s57qxMrOHDTZ%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-312c58bcfd0a5aac519b5bac7c019b09e3cbe9c2%2Fproduct-documentation\_thousandeyes-basics\_thousandeyes-view-layouts-13.png?alt=media)

        ).
    *   When a city contains more than one agent, the number of agents is shown inside the circle (

        ![](https://2360053865-files.gitbook.io/\~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M4QARF6s57qxMrOHDTZ%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-ca42a84252925c4a6fa2391597ce1020a04b6586%2Fproduct-documentation\_thousandeyes-basics\_thousandeyes-view-layouts-14.png?alt=media)

        ) – Hover over the location on the map to select an individual agent from that city. Location colors on this map are based on the selected metric (#3). The image below shows an expanded list of the agents shown by hovering over an agent with a number inside it, and shows the test results for the individual agents in the location.

![](https://2360053865-files.gitbook.io/\~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M4QARF6s57qxMrOHDTZ%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-ac104ef2d433615254c3864a20c3b4660f1f15ec%2Fproduct-documentation\_thousandeyes-basics\_thousandeyes-view-layouts-15.png?alt=media)

1.  1\.

    **Save button:** Click the **Save** button to permanently save a period of data of up to two days.
2.  2\.

    **Share button:** Click the **Share** button to create Share Links or export data in XML or JSON format.
3.  3\.

    **Run Now:** Run an Instant Test using this test as a base configuration.

There are currently two other views being used within the platform, and they're sufficiently different enough to document them individually.

The following table shows a list of tests and links to articles describing how to interact with the views for each test.
