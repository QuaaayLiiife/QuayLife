# Browser Synthetics Disambiguation

**Browser Synthetics vs. BrowserBot:** Within this documentation, _browser synthetics_ refers to two test types - page load and transaction - and to the views and data produced by those test types on the ThousandEyes platform. These tests rely on a set of software components that are collectively referred to as BrowserBot, and are installed from the **te-browserbot** Linux package. These components run on the ThousandEyes Cloud and Enterprise Agents. For information on BrowserBot and the **te-browserbot** package, see
