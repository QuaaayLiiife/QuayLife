# Transaction Tests

ThousandEyes transaction tests are scripted synthetic user interactions with web-based applications such as online shopping or video streaming. Unlike the page load test, which only checks if the front page responds, a transaction test can traverse multiple pages and user actions. Transaction tests run on ThousandEyes enterprise and cloud agents using a component called BrowserBot, running Googleâ€™s Chromium browser.
