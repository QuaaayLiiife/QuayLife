# Getting Started With Transaction Tests

ThousandEyes transaction tests mimic user journeys through web applications, enabling you to make sure those journeys complete successfully and providing insight into the user experience. The video below reviews basic transaction testing concepts and data views, and demonstrates how to create your first transaction test.

After reviewing the video above, you can try using the ThousandEyes Recorder together with the ThousandEyes platform to generate the script for a simple transaction test such as loading a publicly available home page and clicking a page element to navigate to a second page.

However, there are many more aspects to transaction tests than these simple exercises can convey. After you’ve created a sample test and viewed the test results on the **Cloud & Enterprise Agents > Views** page, the next step is to review the following pages:

*   ​

    [Working with Web Development Tools](<../.gitbook/assets/working with web development tools>)
