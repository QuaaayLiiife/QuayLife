# Getting Started with ThousandEyes

This article gives a quick overview of how to use the ThousandEyes platform and directs you to locations where you can find more information. If you think you've got what it takes, skip forward to adding tests and agents, and come back here to understand everything later.

Check out this helpful video on getting started with the ThousandEyes platform.

Before anything, understand where you can find information:

* The **Page Guide**, available on any ThousandEyes page, is an overlay that shows where specific elements are on each page and provides short descriptions of each.
*   **Customer Success Center**, available at

    [https://support.thousandeyes.com](https://support.thousandeyes.com/)

    , provides access to documentation, Community forums, and Tickets submitted through our support system.
* Contact our Customer Engineering team, using any of the following means:
  * **Live chat:** Join us by chat by selecting the "?" icon, in the upper right side of the platform view and selecting the "Chat with Support" Link. Begin your chats in the pop-up window that comes up at the lower right of the ThousandEyes interface. This allows you to chat in real time with members of our Customer Engineering Team.
  * **Call us**, at +1 (415) 237-EYES

Next, start to understand the layouts used by the platform. There are two standard layouts, used by various views within the ThousandEyes platform. Once you understand how the layouts are structured, you can navigate the various views with ease:

*   **Menus and navigation** are standard across the platform. For information on menus and navigation, consult the _Navigation Bar and Menu_ section of the

    [layouts article](https://github.com/thousandeyes/docs/blob/prod/product-documentation/thousandeyes-basics/thousandeyes-view-layouts.md)

    .
*   **Standard layout**: Most views within the platform use this layout. For details on how the standard layout works, see

    [this article](https://github.com/thousandeyes/docs/blob/prod/product-documentation/thousandeyes-basics/thousandeyes-view-layouts.md)

    .
*   **DNS+ layout**: All DNS+ tests use this layout. DNS+ is an optional module, and not available to all ThousandEyes account subscriptions. For more information on the DNS+ layout, review

    [this article](https://github.com/thousandeyes/docs/blob/prod/product-documentation/thousandeyes-basics/thousandeyes-view-layouts.md)

    .

You're on your way! Next, start working to understand each test by type, and the metrics returned by each type of test.

Test types are documented in the _Adding Tests_ article, but if you want a quick sneak peek, have a look at test information

[here](https://github.com/thousandeyes/docs/blob/prod/product-documentation/tests/working-with-test-settings.md)

.

At a high level, the metrics returned by the platform are captured in the _ThousandEyes Metrics_ article. See

[here](https://github.com/thousandeyes/docs/blob/prod/product-documentation/thousandeyes-basics/thousandeyes-metrics-what-do-your-results-mean.md)

for more details.

To deploy tests which take measurements from inside your own infrastructure, or to test assets that are not exposed to the internet, you need to deploy one or more Enterprise Agents. Documentation on deploying Enterprise Agents can be found

[here](https://github.com/thousandeyes/docs/blob/prod/product-documentation/thousandeyes-basics/working-with-agent-settings.md)

.

Now you're ready to grab the bull by the horns and start testing. Great! Adding tests is fully explained in

### Adding Users and Managing Your Account <a href="#adding-users-and-managing-your-account" id="adding-users-and-managing-your-account"></a>

Account management is built into the **Account Settings** tab and allows organization admins to manage all settings for their account. Two articles will help in understanding account management:

1.  1\.

    [Understanding Roles and Permissions](https://github.com/thousandeyes/docs/blob/prod/product-documentation/user-management/role-based-access-control-explained.md)

    \- This document outlines the permissions for each of the three user roles, and helps in determining which user role to assign to each of your users.
2.  2\.

Great, now you've got a test or two configured, and want to customize your alert rules. Alerting is configured out of the box to alert you when you need information about tests which are failing. If you need to get more granular, or change some of the notification rules, check out

[this article](https://github.com/thousandeyes/docs/blob/prod/product-documentation/alerts/how-alerts-work.md)

for information on fine-tuning and managing alerts.

Reporting is simple: you can generate a report, view existing reports, or run instant tests. Check out these helpful articles on the topics below:
