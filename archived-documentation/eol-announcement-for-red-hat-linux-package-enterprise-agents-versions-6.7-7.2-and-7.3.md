# EOL Announcement for Red Hat Linux Package Enterprise Agents: Versions 6.7, 7.2, and 7.3

For users of version 6.7 or earlier versions, ThousandEyes strongly encourages customers to upgrade to the most recent Red Hat 7 version rather than a updating to the latest minor revision of version 6.x, as development by Red Hat on version 6 is limited and will likely have less development over time. Additionally, customers have limited options for new Agent creation, as ThousandEyes does not support

[Enterprise Agent deployment using Docker](https://github.com/thousandeyes/docs/blob/prod/product-documentation/archived-documentation/enterprise-agent-deployment-using-docker.md)

on version 6.x of Red Hat, CentOS or Oracle Linux. Please

contact ThousandEyes Customer Engineering

if you need advice on managing the upgrade or replacement of your Agents.
