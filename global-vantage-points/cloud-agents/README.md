# Cloud Agents

Cloud Agents provide most of the configuration options that Enterprise Agents provide, but because Cloud Agents are used by multiple customers, some features are not available. For example, Cloud Agents cannot be configured to run Web Layer tests through a proxy server, as this would require all tests run by the agent to use the proxy. For use cases such as testing a cloud-based proxy server, use an Enterprise Agent or Endpoint Agent.
