# Enterprise Agents

Enterprise Agents require modest hardware resources, and so are easily deployed in your own network, in data centers, branch offices or in IaaS provider environments. They can be deployed in several ways: as virtual machines running in software hypervisors or IaaS environments, virtual services on virtualized networking platforms, as Linux packages, as Docker containers, or as ISO images onto supported hardware platforms.
