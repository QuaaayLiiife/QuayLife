# Agent Unable to Trace Path to Destination?

We are working on a workaround for these specific circumstances, but for now, any Enterprise Agent which shows as green, and indicates 0% loss, with a route which terminates on the edge (or gateway) which is an Apple Airport device can be ignored as a troubleshooting point. The fact that we are showing 100% loss at the edge is an indicator of this behavior, rather than an indicator of loss.
