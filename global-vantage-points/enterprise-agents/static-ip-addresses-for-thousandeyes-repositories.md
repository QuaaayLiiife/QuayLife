# Static IP Addresses for ThousandEyes Repositories

Customers may use these domain names in place of apt.thousandeyes.com and yum.thousandeyes.com in the repository configuration files of the Enterprise Agent systems, and use the domain names or IP addresses in the configuration of network devices if security policies or technical limitations (firewalls or routers which which cannot resolve domain names in rules or ACLs) require static IP address configuration. For guidance on changing the repository location used by your Enterprise Agents refer to the relevant steps for your installation type in how to

. However, we strongly recommend using the default configuration (apt.thousandeyes.com and yum.thousandeyes.com) if at all possible. ThousandEyes attempts to maintain the stability of these IP addresses, but the addresses may change without warning.
