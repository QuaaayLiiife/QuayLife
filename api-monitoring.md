# API Monitoring

### Your Apps Have Evolved. Your API Monitoring Should, Too.

As applications have grown to encompass ever more functionality, versatility, and connection, they’ve moved from monolithic to more modular, service-based architectures. This more distributed nature of new applications means they often rely on several external third-party services, backend integrations, and cloud APIs spread across the Internet and largely outside the control of the business that owns the application.

Most applications today, even for something as small as placing an item in your cart, rely on a vast underlying ecosystem of web services and platforms distributed across the Internet to do their job—typically via a REST API. ITOps and DevOps teams, to deliver a reliable and high-performance digital experience, should be enabled with the capability to measure and test critical workflows and backend interactions to external API endpoints. And to do that, you need an API monitoring tool that can deliver clear metrics on API performance beyond just uptime, downtime, and latency.
