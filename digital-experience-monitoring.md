# Digital Experience Monitoring

#### What Is Digital Experience Monitoring?

Digital experience is the IT outcome that matters most. But digital experience increasingly depends on a host of external services, like cloud, SaaS and the Internet, that you don’t own or directly control. While you might not own all the underlying infrastructure, you still own user experience.

Digital Experience Monitoring (DEM) has emerged as a new Gartner IT category to address user experience, human or machine, across every dependency, whether network or service, inside or outside your company. DEM upends traditional siloed monitoring tools designed for internal IT environments, such as network performance management (NPM) and application performance monitoring (APM), by looking at the entire digital journey and how every part of it drives successful user actions. By focusing on visibility into digital experience as a whole, DEM helps bridge IT initiatives to business outcomes, such as revenue and customer satisfaction.

DEM solutions leverage a variety of technologies, including synthetic transaction monitoring (STM), network visibility, endpoint and real user monitoring (RUM) to deliver a real-time 360° view of user experience. Together, these technologies enable you to deliver on the promise of a dramatically transformed IT landscape.

Paradigm shifts have seen the Internet become the new enterprise backbone, SaaS the new application stack, and cloud the new data center. These changes are redefining the role that IT plays inside organizations as well as how it delivers high-quality, secure, and reliable user experiences that meet expectations across increasingly dispersed and dynamic environments.

#### Your World Has Completely Changed

The cloud is your new data center, the Internet is your new network, and SaaS is your new application stack. This has led to complex hybrid deployments that enterprise IT operations is struggling to align to the needs of the business. For you to thrive and become an essential strategic stakeholder for your organization, you need to see and understand how your entire digital supply chain, from CDN to back-end APIs, is delivering for your customers and employees.
