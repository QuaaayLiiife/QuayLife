# Website Monitoring Solution

### Website Monitoring With ThousandEyes

ThousandEyes helps you monitor CDN-fronted services by measuring performance and detecting issues with content delivery. Whether you use one CDN in a single geography, or load balance several around the world, visibility into edge locations and paths to your origin servers is invaluable for troubleshooting.

#### Web Performance Visibility for Core Web Vitals

Google’s core web vitals initiative seeks to improve user experience by placing a greater emphasis on performance metrics, including Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), First Input Delay (FID), and Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS). Performance on these metrics can have a significant impact on a website’s domain authority and subsequent Google search performance. ThousandEyes Network and Application Synthetics with browser transaction testing provides a detailed understanding of real-time website performance by measuring specific web events, from page load metrics to web component waterfalls, so you can identify bottlenecks and streamline website performance.
