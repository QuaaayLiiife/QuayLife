    Launch a

    [one-time](https://docs.thousandeyes.com/product-documentation/device-layer/discovering-device-layer-devices#one-time-discovery)

    or

    [scheduled](https://docs.thousandeyes.com/product-documentation/device-layer/discovering-device-layer-devices#scheduled-discovery)

    device discovery action.
3.  3\.

    ​

    [View the results of the device discovery](https://docs.thousandeyes.com/product-documentation/device-layer/device-discovery-results)
