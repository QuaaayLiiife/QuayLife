# HTTP Server Test Fails with SSL Error: OpenSSL SSL\_connect: SSL\_ERROR\_SYSCALL

If the error occurs when the test is run from one or more ThousandEyes Cloud Agents, the reset packet is likely issued either by the server, or an intermediate device close to the server, such as a load balancer, reverse proxy, firewall or some similar security device. The more Cloud Agents receiving the error, the more likely the reset is issued close to or from the server.
