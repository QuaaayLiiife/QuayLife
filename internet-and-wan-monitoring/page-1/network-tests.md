# Network Tests

Select any combination of Cloud and Enterprise Agents and a target URL or IP address. ThousandEyes sends lightweight bursts of TCP or ICMP traffic from agents to the target to measure loss, latency, and jitter. When you have agents on both ends, you can also run network tests between them that use UDP.
