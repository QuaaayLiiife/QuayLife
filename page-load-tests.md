# Page Load Tests

A ThousandEyes page load test measures the performance of an individual web page. This test uses a Chromium-based browser running on a Cisco ThousandEyes Cloud or Enterprise Agent. In addition to showing total page load time, the page load test shows the load times for each of the Document Object Model (DOM) components on the page.
