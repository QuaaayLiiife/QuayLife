# Getting Started with Tests

The _test_ is the basic unit in the ThousandEyes platform. You'll set up tests to monitor services that your customers and employees use.

Tests are categorized by what kind of agent runs the test, and by layers of operation.

This set of tests touches on various Web technologies starting from the most basic measurement of availability of web server all the way up to performing precision transactions on a target.

#### Unscheduled Tests (User Sessions) <a href="#unscheduled-tests-user-sessions" id="unscheduled-tests-user-sessions"></a>

Endpoint Agents record in-browser and network performance metrics whenever users navigate to monitored domains from monitored networks.

The Endpoint Agent also supports running agent-to-agent tests and HTTP server tests as scheduled tests.
