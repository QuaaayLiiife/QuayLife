# Getting Started with Global Vantage Points

Enterprise Agents are vantage points deployed locally (behind the firewalls of an organization) by customers to monitor their data centers, cloud VPCs/VNETs, branch offices, and other internal or Internet-based network assets. These vantage points are installed as either a package for a supported Linux distribution (see

[Supported Enterprise Agent Operating Systems](https://docs.thousandeyes.com/product-documentation/global-vantage-points/enterprise-agents/installing/supported-enterprise-agent-operating-systems)

), or as a pre-packaged virtual appliance that can be deployed into a number of different hypervisor platforms.
