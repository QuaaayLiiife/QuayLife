# Getting Support from ThousandEyes

There are a number of ways to contact us to request assistance from the ThousandEyes Customer Engineering team. Depending on your needs and the information exchanged, one method may be preferable to others. Additionally, knowing in advance what information the Customer Engineering team requires for different types of problems can inform the choice of contact method. Moreover, providing necessary information, particularly at first contact, can reduce the time spent by both you and the Customer Engineering team in resolving questions or problems.

This article describes the methods available for you to contact the ThousandEyes Customer Engineering team, the types of assistance provided by the Customer Engineering team, and outlines the types of information needed by our team when addressing different categories of questions or problems.

ThousandEyes provides searchable documentation covering commonly needed information, located at

[docs.thousandeyes.com](https://docs.thousandeyes.com/)

. Users are encouraged to check the documentation for useful information prior to submitting a support request. The documentation may have the answer you need! If not, users may still gain valuable context to better describe their needs to us. If your question has no relevant articles in the documentation, let us know in your request so that we can either expand an existing article or create a new one.

For questions that aren't answered in our documentation, Customer Engineering provides technical support to customers who have existing accounts for the ThousandEyes application. Support requests can address the following:

* Questions about product functionality
* Requests to analyze test results
* Reports of possible bugs or other platform issues

The scope of assistance will normally be focused on single issues. Requests submitted covering multiple subject areas may be split into separate support cases as necessary. Customers requiring extensive assistance in learning how to use the product, interpreting results or performing configuration of the product may require a referral to our Professional Services team.

Some things that can't be obtained from a support request:

* Purchase of Enterprise Agent, Endpoint Agents or Device Layer licences, or additional units.
* New trial accounts or extensions of existing accounts.
* Changes to configuration or account information for which the requestor lacks privilege.
* Cisco entitlements and licenses purchased thought the Cisco Global Price List.

For Cisco entitlements and GPL license information, reach out to your Cisco or ThousandEyes Account Manager.

For pricing information and other sales-related issues, we can put you in touch with your ThousandEyes Account Manager, Solutions Engineer, or other contacts within our Sales team, or with your company’s internal ThousandEyes contact.

Customers can contact the ThousandEyes Customer Engineering team 24 hours a day, 7 days a week through email, chat app and via the web at our support portal. All contacts will be logged in a case within the Customer Engineering team's ticketing system. Each case has a number of the form "S-CS-XXXXXXX", where XXXXXXX is a seven-digit number.

If needed, we may request a remote desktop session, either via an online collaboration application (such as Cisco Webex or Zoom) or with a remote desktop application used by your organization.

Email is a good choice when providing high volumes of text information, such as large sections of log files, multiple screenshots or similar attachments.

The Customer Engineering team can be reached at

\[email protected]

. When emailing Customer Engineering, users should ideally send email from the account which is used to log into the ThousandEyes application (

[app.thousandeyes.com](https://app.thousandeyes.com/)

) in order to ensure that we can associate the sending email address with the correct organization and case history in our ticketing system. If you need to receive email at an address other than the one you use to log into the application, let us know in the email.

Also, if the email address associated with a ThousandEyes account is used by multiple people, such as \[email protected], please include your name in the body of the email (such as in an email signature) so that we know which person on your team has contacted us.

Additional people can be included in an email to us via the CC option. Our ticketing system will add all CC'd email addresses to the support case, so that subsequent responses will be sent to those CC'd on the initial request, and will be notified of case updates.

Email responses from us use an ID tag at the bottom of the email to associate future responses with the existing case. The ID tag has the form:

Please do not remove this tag: \[ref:\_00ABCDeFg.\_1234567hIJk:ref]

Please avoid deleting this tag from your email responses, if possible. Email replies which do not have the ID tag will result in new cases being opened. Multiple cases opened for a single issue can be merged into one case by Customer Engineering, but to avoid confusion over the correct case number, email replies should contain the ID tag if possible.

For customers seeking interactive support, the ThousandEyes app provides a live chat client, which can be accessed from the **Help & Support** menu in the top navigation bar:

![](https://2360053865-files.gitbook.io/\~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M4QARF6s57qxMrOHDTZ%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-ae47343d0e8f7abb7f02c93f4c239b013a782172%2Fproduct-documentation\_getting-started\_getting-support-from-thousandeyes-1\_2.png?alt=media)

In the **Self Directed Learning** option, the question type and the product area will be automatically populated based on the page you were on when you opened the chat. If you need help with something different, adjust the dropdown to ensure you are routed to the correct resource.

In the **Chat with an Engineer** option, enter a problem description and select **Submit**. You will be connected to the next available engineer. When the chat has ended, the chat transcript is automatically generated and emailed to the user at the email address used to log into the ThousandEyes app.

Customers who log into the ThousandEyes app have easy access to the support portal

[https://success.thousandeyes.com](https://success.thousandeyes.com/)

, which provides support case creation, as well as displaying their support case history and other support information. Additionally, web access can be used by customers whose organizations block live chat and/or email due to security requirements.

Access the portal from from the **Help** icon in the top navigation bar:

![](https://2360053865-files.gitbook.io/\~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M4QARF6s57qxMrOHDTZ%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-39fedabfaa6ff3893df9dbeddde8fb2ac5e7b310%2Fproduct-documentation\_getting-started\_getting-support-from-thousandeyes-3.png?alt=media)

Select the **Contact Support** option to display the customer's support portal page. Select the **Cases** tab to open a support case or view existing cases:

![](https://2360053865-files.gitbook.io/\~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M4QARF6s57qxMrOHDTZ%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-1d64dddfc8309e95e1e36aed0eef369b29d2ceef%2Fproduct-documentation\_getting-started\_getting-support-from-thousandeyes-4.png?alt=media)

Our team may request a screen-sharing session to facilitate the handling of your request. The session will be performed using Cisco Webex, Zoom or your company’s screen-sharing solution.

**Data Collection Needed Before Online Collaboration**

To facilitate an effective online collaboration via Webex, be prepared to provide some background information on the issue before the Webex session. In many cases, providing this background information will enable the engineer helping you to run checks and investigations on the ThousandEyes side of the issue. This allows the online collaboration session to focus on gathering data that is not available on the ThousandEyes side of things, and allows the engineer to use your important and limited time as efficiently as possible.

Things that Customer Engineering will often request before starting an online collaboration session include:

* Names of any agents involved
* Names of any tests involved
* Names (and if possible IDs) of any alerts involved
* Logs or diagnostic files from the involved agents
* A clear description of the issue you are facing
  * Is an agent not checking in?
  * Do you need an alert explained?
  * Is a test suddenly failing and you need to know why?
  * Has a new test ever worked as expected and you need it working?
  * Are you having issues installing an agent?

We are happy to help you in any way we can, but please remember we have seen many of the issues customers bring to us before. So by gathering this sort of information ahead of time, we may be able to just look up our internal notes on the issue and may have a plan already available for how to address this issue.

**Data Collection needed before an Online Collaboration starts.**

To facilitate an effective Online Collaboration via Webex, please be prepared to provide some background information on what the issue is before the Webex happens. In many cases providing this background information will enable the engineer helping you to run checks and investigations on the ThousandEyes side of the issue. Thus enabling the Online Collaboration session(s) to be targeted on gathering data that is not available on the ThousandEyes side of things. This allows the engineer to use your important and limited time as efficiently as possible.

Webex is a browser-based application that allows conferencing via audio and video, and permits sharing of the desktop on a computer running Webex. Normally, Customer Enablement Engineers use Webex when we need to view a customer's desktop in real time, or to do conference calls, such as with a ThousandEyes customer and a support engineer of another vendor. Normally, video is not necessary, and we avoid using the video function due to the greater bandwidth requirements than audio.

If a Customer Enablement Engineer needs a remote desktop sharing session via Webex, the Engineer will provide the customer with a Webex URL, which can be shared with co-workers or third parties, if desired. The URL will begin with

[https://thousandeyes.webex.com](https://thousandeyes.webex.com/)

, which uses TLS encryption to provide privacy and security for the session (if the URL does not begin with this exact string, please inform Customer Engineering before using the URL). If the Webex is needed for viewing your desktop, be sure to close any applications displaying sensitive or proprietary information prior to starting the Webex.

Click the URL to go to the Webex login page, requests a name and email address. Click either the **Join** or **Join by browser** button to start the Webex and see options for selecting audio and video connections. As mentioned above, we don't usually need video, and prefer to avoid it to save bandwidth, so select **No Video** unless we've requested otherwise. For the audio setting, normally select the **Call using Computer** to use the computer's microphone and speakers. If the computer cannot support audio, we suggest the **Call Me** option, which will allow the Webex application to call a telephone number provided by the customer.

Webex meetings can also be joined by phone directly, which provides access to the audio portion of the Webex. Consult the

[list of access phone numbers](https://thousandeyes.webex.com/cmp3300/webcomponents/widget/globalcallin/globalcallin.do?siteurl=thousandeyes\&serviceType=MC\&ED=342087012\&tollFree=0)

per country. The meeting's nine-digit meeting access code will be required to join by phone.

Basic Webex functionality can be performed without installation of software (such as browser plug-ins) by using the **Join by browser** option. If full Webex functionality is desired, software can be downloaded in advance of the Webex to save time, and to ensure that Webex functions correctly. Go to

[https://www.webex.com/test-meeting.html](https://www.webex.com/test-meeting.html)

and follow the instructions to set up and test Webex on your computer. If possible, we recommend performing the test on the same network you will use when meeting with us.

Zoom is a collaboration tool similar to Webex, having browser-based and stand-alone clients. See Zoom's page about

[Getting started on PC and Mac](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362033-Getting-Started-on-PC-and-Mac)

for more information on setting up Zoom. Go to

[http://zoom.us/test](http://zoom.us/test)

and follow the instructions to set up and test Zoom on your computer. If possible, we recommend performing the test on the same network you will use when meeting with us.

For high-priority issues, you can contact ThousandEyes Customer Engineering (415) 237-EYES. Callers will be routed to the next available engineer in order to receive the reported issues.

### 日本語対応について (Japanese-Language Support) <a href="#nitsuite-japanese-language-support" id="nitsuite-japanese-language-support"></a>

日本国内のお客様を対象に、グローバルサポートチームのサブセットとして、日本語対応窓口を提供しています。Eメール \[email protected]、またWebポータル まで、日本語でご連絡ください。

日本語対応ができるThousandEyesのサポートチームが、日本時間の月曜から金曜まで、8:00am - 5:00 pmにて受付（年末年始を除く）、翌営業日以内にご返信いたします。グローバルサポート同様、サポートケース番号が発行されます。なお、チャットによる日本語サポートは現在対応していません。

### Information to Provide to Customer Engineering <a href="#information-to-provide-to-customer-engineering" id="information-to-provide-to-customer-engineering"></a>

The following section describes information that will normally be required (as well as some types of information that we will never ask for) when opening a support case for various categories of problems. We recommend obtaining this information prior to opening your support request, as some types of information may take time to gather, and may be required before our Customer Enablement Engineers can begin acting upon your request.

In addition to information specific to the type of problem, providing the current account group name is always helpful, as a user may be a member of many account groups. A user's current account group is displayed in rightmost corner of the navigation bar, at the top of the ThousandEyes application:

![](https://2360053865-files.gitbook.io/\~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M4QARF6s57qxMrOHDTZ%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-4b8248373e17ede33184986888e2cf37629f693e%2Fproduct-documentation\_getting-started\_getting-support-from-thousandeyes-5.png?alt=media)

In the image above, the user's current account group is **Support**.

When submitting a support request about one or more test's results, the best way to provide us information is by sharing a Snapshot link. See the article

[Sharing Test Data](https://docs.thousandeyes.com/product-documentation/tests/sharing-test-data#snapshots)

for information on generating snapshot links. Note that snapshots do not contain any alert information seen in the full test view, so see the **Alerts** section below for information on referencing alerts.

#### Enterprise or Endpoint Agents <a href="#enterprise-or-endpoint-agents" id="enterprise-or-endpoint-agents"></a>

Problems with installation or operation of Enterprise Agent or Endpoint Agents typically require log file information from the Agent, or similar files such as an Enterprise Agent's configuration file. Information on the most commonly needed files is listed below.

* **/tmp/install\_thousandeyes\_XXXXXXXX.log** (installation of Linux package-based agents; XXXXXXXX is a random character string)
* **/var/lib/te-browserbot/log/te-browserbot.log** (for Browserbot process errors, and page load and transaction test issues)

Problems that cannot be solved solely by inspection of log files may require a remote desktop session with a Customer Enablement Engineer to investigate the agent and the system on which the agent runs. For Enterprise Agents, we will need command-line access via the remote desktop to the Enterprise Agent. Normally, this means having an SSH client available to access the agent. If possible, before the remote desktop session ensure that an SSH client is installed and configured to log into the Enterprise Agent. If needed, review the instructions for configuring SSH on

[Windows](https://docs.thousandeyes.com/product-documentation/global-vantage-points/enterprise-agents/configuring/connecting-to-the-thousandeyes-virtual-appliance-using-ssh-windows)

,

[Mac and Linux](https://docs.thousandeyes.com/product-documentation/global-vantage-points/enterprise-agents/configuring/connecting-to-the-thousandeyes-virtual-appliance-using-ssh-mac-linux)

systems.

#### Remote Data Tools Available to ThousandEyes Support for Enterprise and Endpoint Agents <a href="#remote-data-tools-available-to-thousandeyes-support-for-enterprise-and-endpoint-agents" id="remote-data-tools-available-to-thousandeyes-support-for-enterprise-and-endpoint-agents"></a>

ThousandEyes Support has access to a suite of troubleshooting tools that request data from Enterprise and Endpoint Agents. Agents behind a proxy or located in networks where RPC is not supported may not work with this suite of tools. In the event that ThousandEyes Support cannot obtain data required for troubleshooting support cases, we will request assistance from customers.

The following is a list of troubleshooting data that may be obtained remotely:

* **Agent logs:** ThousandEyes Linux packages generate logs used for diagnostics and troubleshooting. These logs are requested via an RPC connection.
* **Packet captures:** ThousandEyes Support may remotely trigger a packet capture for up to five minutes in duration. Packet captures are requested via an RPC connection. Use of this tool requires that the **tcpdump** linux package be installed on the host operating system.
* **SNMP Walk:** ThousandEyes Support may remotely trigger an SNMP walk for devices discovered or monitored via SNMP. An SNMP walk is requested via an RPC connection.
* **Crash reports:** Crash reports are created when an Agent experiences failure. These reports are requested via an RPC connection.

In the event that the above information cannot be obtained, ThousandEyes Support will request that a customer obtain this data. Instructions on connecting to Enterprise Agents via ssh from Windows hosts is available

[here](https://docs.thousandeyes.com/product-documentation/global-vantage-points/enterprise-agents/configuring/connecting-to-the-thousandeyes-virtual-appliance-using-ssh-windows)

. Instructions on connecting to Enterprise Agents via ssh from Linux and OSX hosts is available

[here](https://docs.thousandeyes.com/product-documentation/global-vantage-points/enterprise-agents/configuring/connecting-to-the-thousandeyes-virtual-appliance-using-ssh-mac-linux)

.

* **Agent logs:** Endpoint Agents generate logs used for diagnostics and troubleshooting. These logs may be requested remotely when an Endpoint Agent checks into the ThousandEyes platform.

In the event that the logs cannot be obtained remotely, ThousandEyes Support will request that a customer assist in obtaining this data. Instructions on obtaining diagnostics logs for Endpoint Agents is available

[here](https://docs.thousandeyes.com/product-documentation/global-vantage-points/endpoint-agents/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-endpoint-agent-issues)

.

Every alert generated by ThousandEyes has a unique number, called an Alert ID. When submitting a support request about one or more alerts, he best way to provide us information is by providing the Alert ID. See the ThousandEyes article

[How Alerts work](https://docs.thousandeyes.com/product-documentation/alerts)

for information on obtaining and using an Alert ID.

When submitting a support request about one or more reports or dashboards, the best way to provide us information is by providing the account group (as illustrated above) and report's or dashboard's URL from the address bar of the browser, when viewing the report or dashboard in the ThousandEyes application. Example URLs of a report and a dashboard, respectively:

When submitting a support request about an API query, please provide the username, URL used for the query, and any XML or JSON data sent in a query (usually for writing to the API) via the HTTP POST method. For example:

* https://api.thousandeyes.com/v6/tests/agent-to-server/new.json
*   "testName": "Agent to Server test for www.thousandeyes.com",

    "server": "www.thousandeyes.com",

Do not provide us with your API token! Also be certain to remove any sensitive information from POST query data, such as passwords for web site or proxies in Web Layer tests, or for authenticated Voice Layer tests.

Customers may request enhancements to the ThousandEyes product by feature requests, which can be submitted through a support case. Feel free to tell us what you want in the product! It's best if you can also tell us why you want what you want, and provide an example/use case to illustrate the benefits of the proposed feature.

Additionally, feature requests can be submitted via your Account Manager or Solutions Engineer.

### Information That Should Not Be Provided <a href="#information-that-should-not-be-provided" id="information-that-should-not-be-provided"></a>

Certain information should not be provided to Customer Engineering. Information from production systems such as user passwords and password-like information should not be sent via email or chat, or exposed during a remote desktop session.

The following are examples of information which should not be transmitted via email or chat:

*
  * for your ThousandEyes app account
  * for a Web or Voice Layer test
  * for a private key associated with a digital certificate
* Files such which contain passwords, tokens or other sensitive information, such as:
  * configuration files (**te-agent.cfg** from an Enterprise Agent, for example)

In the event that sensitive information is disclosed during a support inquiry, our team may recommend you make changes to the information to ensure that no security concerns are created for your organization. Always maintain compliance with your organization's information security policies and procedures when obtaining support from ThousandEyes.
