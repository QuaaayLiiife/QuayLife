# Getting Started with Path Visualization

Each routing device that receives this packet decreases the value by 1 before routing it to the next hop. When the TTL value equals 0, a standard routing device drops the incoming packet and replies with an ICMP TTLx packet, indicating that the packet will be dropped at this point. The next packet in the path trace sequence will have a TTL value set to 2, followed by a packet with a TTL of 3, and so on. This process continues until the agent receives a response from the intended target, or the path is deemed unresponsive. For more information about how traceroute works, see
