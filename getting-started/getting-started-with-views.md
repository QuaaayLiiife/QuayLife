# Getting Started with Views

The **Timeline** is the primary focus of the **Cloud and Enterprise Agents > Views** page. It shows test data from the last 14 days, or the length of time the test has been enabled (whichever is the lesser value). The data shown on the timeline can be manipulated by selecting the shortcuts for 24 hours (24h), 7 days (7d), or 14 days (14d), by clicking within the timeline to select a particular round of data, or highlighting a range within the timeline to focus on a smaller time period.
