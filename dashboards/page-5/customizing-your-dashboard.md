# Customizing Your Dashboard

Widget configuration as described in

[Dashboard Widgets](broken-reference)

includes visual arrangement of the numbers, tables and time series graphs on the page. When viewing a dashboard, you can select a time frame of interest as described in

[Using the Dashboard](https://product-documentation/dashboards/using-the-dashboard)

, and the dashboard page populates with that time period's test data according to the dashboard configuration. Configuration involves choosing the widgets, and configuring their settings as a one-time action. By contrast, time frame selection, which you might do many times over, only happens after the widgets have been configured.
