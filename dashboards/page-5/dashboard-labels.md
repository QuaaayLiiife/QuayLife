# Dashboard Labels

Labels provide an easy-to-use folder structure that allows you to organize your data visualization efforts in the ThousandEyes platform. Labels make it easier to group and monitor several applications, multiple locations, or thousands of endpoints.

You can create a label for a specific context and assign the corresponding dashboards. This way, when you filter the dashboard selection and select a label, only the assocaited dashboards are displayed. You can also **Group By** labels, meaning the hierarchy of the dashboard selector will have a label as its top-level association and every dashboard associated with that label will fall under that hierarchy.

By default, you can group and sort the dashboards by labels, but you must have the `SETTINGS_LABELS_UPDATE` permission in order to manage the labels. You can find more information on permissions
