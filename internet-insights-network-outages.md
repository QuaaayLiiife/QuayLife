# Internet Insights: Network Outages

### Complete Visibility for Your Digital Supply Chain

The Internet is vast, unpredictable and prone to outages that can negatively impact your customers’ and employees’ digital experiences. Network outages can be notoriously difficult to isolate and troubleshoot in real-time (particularly when they occur in an upstream provider’s network), and they can have severe impacts on your business.

ThousandEyes Internet Insights: Network Outages gives IT teams deep visibility into Internet services and cloud environments—over every network hop and routing path. Using a fleet of pre-deployed global vantage points, Internet Insights™ detects network outage events taking place across Internet Service Providers (ISPs), public clouds (such as Amazon Web Services or AWS, Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure) and edge service networks (such as CDNs, DNS and SECaaS), providing unrivaled visibility into the providers that your business relies on.

### Powerful Outage Detection, Powered by Collective Intelligence

Internet Insights leverages a massive collective intelligence data set to algorithmically identify common points where traffic is terminating within service provider networks to quickly detect network outages across the Internet.

#### Visualize Global Internet Health

#### Determine Outage Scope and Severity
